//! Poki Setup's core: everything the desktop app and the `poki-setup` command do, with no UI in it.
//!
//! - [`device`]: the iPhone over USB (usbmuxd) or Wi-Fi (the pairing record): pairing, facts,
//!   Developer Mode, installing, the app container, the developer disk image, logs.
//! - [`pairshare`]: hands the pairing file to Poki on the phone over the local network, as the
//!   `poki://pairing?url=…&sha256=…` link Poki opens from a QR code.
//! - [`apple`]: the Apple account (GSA login with SRP and 2FA, anisette) and the developer portal
//!   (teams, devices, certificates, App IDs, app groups, profiles).
//! - [`sign`]: takes Poki's release IPA and signs it for a team: bundle ids, app groups,
//!   entitlements, profiles, every nested bundle, with the pure-Rust apple-codesign.
//! - [`release`]: Poki's release IPAs from GitHub, checked against their digests.
//! - [`keeper`]: the phones this computer set up, their expiry, what is due.
//! - [`mcp`]: connector links, client snippets, and a `tools/list` check.
//! - [`relay`]: deploys `deploy/cf-relay` to the person's own Cloudflare account.
//! - [`support`]: a support bundle with the secrets taken out.
//!
//! Licences: this crate is AGPL-3.0-only like the rest of Poki. The GSA login follows Apple's
//! protocol as implemented in SideStore's icloud-auth (MPL-2.0) and Dadoum's Sideloader
//! (GPL-3.0); the entitlement rule is AltSign's (AGPL-3.0). See THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.
