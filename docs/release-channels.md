# Release channels

Poki's iPhone builds are published as GitHub Releases on this repository. Poki Setup (the desktop
installer) reads them and lets each person pick a channel in Settings. A channel decides which
releases Poki Setup installs and renews with.

| Channel | Tag | Title | GitHub release | Who it is for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stable | `app-X.Y.Z` | Poki v0.3.0 | its own full release (not marked Latest) | everyone |
| Beta | `app-X.Y.Z-beta.K` | Poki v0.3.0 Beta 1 | its own prerelease | testers |
| Alpha | `app-X.Y.Z-alpha.N` | Poki v0.3.0 (712) Alpha | rolling `app-alpha-latest`, prerelease | early testers |
| Pre-alpha | `app-X.Y.Z-prealpha.N` | Poki v0.3.0 (712) Pre-alpha | rolling `app-prealpha-latest`, prerelease | developers |

A channel includes the channels above it: Beta installs the newest Stable or Beta release, Alpha
the newest Stable, Beta or Alpha, and Pre-alpha the newest release of any kind. Poki Setup's own
updates (`desktop-v*`, `desktop-alpha-*` and `desktop-prealpha-*` tags) follow the same channel.
Poki Setup orders versions so that `0.3.0-beta.1 < 0.3.0-beta.2 < 0.3.0 < 0.3.0-712`: a pre-release
suffix sorts below the plain version, a build number above it.

Until November 2026 app releases were tagged `ios-vX.Y.Z`, `ios-vX.Y.Z-beta.K`, `ios-alpha-X.Y.Z-N` and
`ios-prealpha-X.Y.Z-N`; Poki Setup reads both schemes. Poki Setup 0.2.2 and earlier read only the old
ones, so every pre-alpha and alpha is also copied into the old rolling releases `ios-prealpha-latest`
and `ios-alpha-latest`, which carry the Poki Setup update too. That copy stops once those versions
are gone. Betas and stables exist only as `app-*`.

N is the commit count of the built commit on `main`, so it only goes up while `main` is never
rewritten. Betas and stables drop it from their names; inside the app, `CFBundleVersion` still
carries it.

## One build, promoted

Only the pre-alpha step compiles. Each promotion copies that same IPA to the next channel, so
testers on Alpha run the file that was tried on Pre-alpha, and Beta runs the file the Gym scored.

1. **Pre-alpha, automatic.** Every merge into `main` runs `.github/workflows/prealpha.yml`: one
   macOS job builds the external IPA, tags `app-<VERSION>-prealpha.<N>` and replaces the files of
   `app-prealpha-latest`. Its artifact is kept 90 days for later promotions.
2. **Alpha, one click.** Actions > Promote to Alpha > Run workflow (`promote-alpha.yml`), with a
   pre-alpha tag or empty for the current one. It runs the alpha tests on that commit (`ios-app.yml`:
   PokiCore and loopback tests, in-process field, apps and idle-cycle checks, simulator smoke test,
   agent chat end to end; Poki Setup's core tests), then tags `app-<VERSION>-alpha.<N>` and puts the
   pre-alpha's IPA and Poki Setup files into `app-alpha-latest`.
3. **Beta, by PR.** Actions > Propose promotion > beta (`propose-promotion.yml`), with an alpha tag or
   empty for the current Alpha. The Poki Release Bot opens a PR that adds the promotion to
   `.github/channels.json` and moves `native/ios-app/VERSION` to the next patch version. The PR's
   `promotion gate` check (`promotion-gate.yml`) runs the Gym on that commit and passes when neither
   scorecard has more failures than the last beta's. Merging publishes `app-X.Y.Z-beta.K`
   (`publish-promotion.yml`) with the scorecards attached, and creates `release/X.Y` on a version's
   first beta.
4. **Stable, by PR.** Propose promotion > stable, with a beta tag or empty for the newest beta. The
   gate passes once that beta has been out for `soak_days` (3, in `.github/channels.json`) and no
   issue labelled `blocker` is open. To ship sooner, add the `soak-override` label to the PR, or give
   a reason in the proposal's skip field (it is kept in `channels.json`). Merging publishes
   `app-X.Y.Z` after approval in the `stable` environment.

Every publish creates a draft first, checks its file count, then publishes. Releases carry
`Poki-external-<name>.ipa`, `Poki-signing.zip`, `poki-relay-worker.js` (the relay Worker Poki Setup
deploys) and `SHA256SUMS`, plus Poki Setup's `PokiSetup-*` installers and `SHA256SUMS-desktop.txt`.

## Branches

- `main`: protected trunk; PRs only. Every merge is a pre-alpha.
- `dev/<topic>`: one change, one PR into `main`, deleted on merge.
- `release/X.Y`: from a version's first beta; takes cherry-picked fixes from `main` for later betas
  and X.Y.Z hotfixes.
- `promote/<channel>-<version>`: the bot's promotion PRs.

## Checks

`pr-checks.yml` runs on every PR into `main` or `release/**`, on Linux only so it never takes one of
the 5 macOS runners: Poki Setup's core tests, the Rust lockfiles, and the workflows (actionlint).

## Setup (once)

- A GitHub App for the bot (Contents, Pull requests and Workflows read and write; Actions and Checks
  read), installed on this repository, with its id and private key in the Actions secrets
  `POKI_BOT_APP_ID` and `POKI_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY`.
- Labels `promotion`, `soak-override` and `blocker`.
- Environment `stable` with the maintainers as required reviewers.
- Branch protection on `main`: the `PR checks` jobs and `promotion gate / verdict` as required checks.

## Fallback

`channel-release.yml` still builds from a pushed alpha or pre-alpha tag
(`native/ios-app/scripts/cut-release.sh`). It starts with cold caches (about 20 minutes) and will be
removed once the pipeline above has shipped a few builds.

The Mac server's update notice (`src/update-check.mjs`) reads `releases/latest` and only understands
Poki MCP's `vX.Y.Z` tags, so app releases are never marked Latest: Latest stays on Poki MCP's newest
release.
