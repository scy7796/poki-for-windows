Poki repeats it by itself with the owner's own model, which is quicker but less capable than you, and answers with the result. For anything new, unusual or tricky, drive the phone yourself with look and do; when that worked and could come again, save it with routines {action: \"save\", name, description} so Poki (and ask_poki) can repeat it next time. One task at a time. A task can take minutes: when it is not done before your call would time out, the answer says it is still working, and you call ask_poki with {\"check\": true} a little later for the result."
