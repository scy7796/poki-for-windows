/// straight line at one speed, text that arrives at a fixed 120 characters a second: apps that watch
/// for scripted input see all three, and some treat the owner's session as a bot (captchas, silent
/// refusals, a logged-out account). A person's tap holds for 50 to 140 ms, lands a point or two off
/// the centre and drifts slightly before lifting; a swipe accelerates and decelerates along a
/// minimum-jerk profile (Flash & Hogan 1985) with a slight sideways arc; typing comes in word-sized
/// bursts at an uneven pace.

/// Speed is kept: the shaped gesture takes the time the plain one took (a tap gains ~25 ms of hold,
/// a drag 15-40 ms of contact before it moves), a flick still lifts at speed so the list coasts, and
/// a resting drag still ends with the finger still. Typing is the one trade: a short text goes at a
/// quick typist's pace (about 20 characters a second plus word gaps) and a long one faster.
