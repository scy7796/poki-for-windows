# Changelog

Poki and Poki Runner ship together under one version. Each entry says what changed for the person
using the phone, then what changed underneath. The working notes per round stay in
native/ios-app/CHANGELOG-round.md; this file is what goes into a release and the AltStore source.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
Build numbers are the GitHub Actions run number of the release workflow.

## [0.1.0] - unreleased

First prototype: Poki pairs with the phone it runs on, keeps the runner up over the loopback, answers
MCP (look, do, status) through the person's own relay (no default; `deploy/cf-relay/deploy.sh`), and asks the owner on the Lock Screen
before sensitive actions.
